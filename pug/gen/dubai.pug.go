This means that the cost of this service and your travel costs should be tax deductible. But we can't give tax advice so please check with your tax professional.</dd><dt>When is the event?</dt><dd>November 2nd 2023 to November 15th 2023. You need to be there that long to ensure you get your residency. Of course you are welcome to come earlier or stay later! Dubai is a fantastic place!</dd><dt>When is the deadline for me to sign up?</dt><dd>The price goes up by $500 on August 31st 2023. Your absolute deadline to sign up is October 10th 2023. After that, we can not take anyone else since we might not be able to get your documents prepared in time.</dd><dt>If I don't want to move out of my country, can I still have money on taxes by having a Dubai corporation? Even if I'm an American?</dt><dd>Yes and yes. You won't save as much taxes than if you actually left your high-taxed country, but yes, you can still save some money in taxes even if you don't move away.</dd><dt>Do I just stop paying taxes in my home country if I move to Dubai?</dt><dd>If you're not an American, yes, it's that simple. If you are an American, your first $120,000 per year earned will be tax-free and there are other ways of saving taxes beyond that if you're willing to get creative.</dd><dt>Do I have to live in Dubai/UAE or spend lots of time there to maintain my residency?</dt><dd>No! All you need to do is visit Dubai once every six months. That's it. You can arrive and then leave the same day. Many people just use Dubai as a layover on their way to fly somewhere else and as long as you exit the airport and go back in, that's all you need to do.</dd><dt>How long does it take to get my residency?</dt><dd>You'll have your residency card in your hand when you leave after your 2-week stay. Residency in Dubai is one of the fastest in the world.</dd><dt>How long does my residency last?</dt><dd>2 years. After that you can renew for longer. You will also (likely) have to renew your corporation every year as well and there are annual fees associated with this.</dd><dt>Will I be able to open a bank account once I get my residency?</dt><dd>Yes. You will be able to set up a personal checking/savings account once your residency is done. However, Dubai is a little slow setting up bank accounts and it takes 2-3 weeks to do so, so you'll either need to extend your stay or return to Dubai for a second visit to get this done.</dd><dt>What if something comes up in my schedule and I have to cancel my trip?</dt><dd>No problem. If you have to cancel your November trip you can simply reschedule your trip for a later date, go to Dubai then, and we'll support you over the phone (instead of in-person) and coordinate with the attorneys remotely. Things will be slightly less convenient but we'll still make it work.</dd></dl><a class="btn1" href="#onboarding"><span>Register Now</span></a></section>`
